--- Nice benchmark demonstrating verification
---   of the injectivity property of an array:
---
--- (1) The first goal (function MM):
---   given the precondition that argument `edgeIds_all` is injective
---   we need to prove that the `edgeIds` loop-variant
---   argument of the loop (implementing `MM`) is injective.
---   This is relatively straightforward given that
---   we have the right constructors in the language
---   of properties, since initially `edgeIds` result of an
---   iteration is obtained by filtering the `edgeIds` input
---   of an iteration, hence injectivity should be preserved.
---
--- (2) The second goal is to prove that the safety of the 3 scatters
---   appearing in the code. The two scatters appearing in function
---   `update` are trivial since they have replicated values
---   (easy to check)
---
--- (3) The scatter appearing in MM's loop is the tricky one: it requires
---   proving that the first array result of function `getSmallestPairs`
---   is injective, i.e., given the precondition that the `edgeIds`
---   argument of function `getSmallestPairs` is injective, prove the
---   postcondition that the first array result of `getSmallestPairs` is
---   injective.
---   This can be tackled by proving that `flatE2i` is injective by
---   solving queries of the form:
---       forall i1 < i2, i1 and i2 being elements of edgeIds =>
---         2*i1 != 2*i2 && 2*i1+1 != 2*i2+1 && 2*i1 != 2*i1+1 && 2*i1+1 != 2*i2
---   Then we can exploit that the first result is obtained by a filter
---     operation to create the following query that if solved proves injectivity:
---       for all i1, i2 integers in [0..arraySize) satisfying the properties
---          flatE[i1] == flatE[i2] &&
---          H[flatE[i1]] == flatE2[i1] &&  -- necessary for index i1 to be kept by filter
---          H[flatE[i2]] == flatE2[i2] &&  -- necessary for index i2 to be kept by filter
---       => i1 = i2
---   The proof can be accomplished by a technique aimed at deriving new equalities, e.g.,
---     flatE[i1] == flatE[i2] == z (fresh) => 
---     H[z] == flatE2[i1] && H[z] == flatE2[i2] =>
---     flatE2[i1] == flatE2[i2] => i1 == i2 (because `flatE2` was proved injective)
